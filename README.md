# Cybersecurity5

Welcome to my Cybersecurity repository! This collection showcases hands-on projects and tools I've developed to explore and strengthen key cybersecurity concepts including ethical hacking, secure coding, encryption, vulnerability analysis, and more.

## üß† What You'll Find Here

This repository includes:

- üîç **Vulnerability Scanning** ‚Äì Scripts to identify common security flaws in web applications or local systems.
- üîê **Encryption & Hashing** ‚Äì Implementations of symmetric/asymmetric encryption (e.g., AES, RSA) and hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256, bcrypt).
- üß¨ **Malware Analysis** ‚Äì Static and dynamic analysis of malware samples (in a safe, isolated environment).
- üí£ **Exploitation Scripts** ‚Äì Custom proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for educational purposes.
- üìä **Log Analysis & Detection** ‚Äì Python scripts for parsing system logs and detecting suspicious activity.
- üö® **SIEM Simulations** ‚Äì Small-scale Security Information and Event Management setups for log aggregation and alerting.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Firewall & IDS Testing** ‚Äì Configurations and tests involving firewall rules or open-source intrusion detection systems like Snort.
